```
Create a branch with the name of your pr
```
git checkout -b [your_pr_reference]
```
Example
```
git checkout -b LB-45
```
That's it ! Now create, edit or delete files :clap:
When your feature is ready to be tested, you can make a PR (pull request) :wink:

Don't forget to check your git's state sometimes with
```
git status
```

#### Update local code with master
Fetch and merge data from your master
```
git pull origin master
```
If necessary, resolve conflicts

#### To make a PR, follow these steps
Add changes that you want to stage (file or directory addition, modification or deletion
```
git add [file_or_directory]
```
***or***
To see all modifications you did to those files (recommended)
  Press 'y' to accept, 'n' to deny
```
git add -p
```
***or***
**More risky**, add all files (make a git add -p before)
```
git add .
```
Sometimes you'll need to discard changes
Then you can make a
```
git checkout [file]
```
Stage your changes
```
git commit -m "[PR_reference] [PR_type]/[PR_epic]([PR_domain]): [pr_description]"
```
Example
```
git commit -m "LB-45 feat/front(homepage): change background color and font size"
```
Push your changes on your branche's origin to submit a pull request

**/!\ Never push on master ! /!\ **
